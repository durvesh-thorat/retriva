AI Usage Disclaimer
This website uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist in matching lost and found items, generating content, and powering our support chatbot. Our goal is to streamline the recovery process and provide quick, helpful information.
Important Considerations:
Accuracy Not Guaranteed: AI systems learn from data patterns and may generate responses or matches that are inaccurate, incomplete, or contain errors ("hallucinations").
Human Review Recommended: We strongly advise users to independently verify all critical information and AI-generated matches. Do not rely on AI outputs as the sole source of truth.
Not a Substitute for Human Judgment: AI features are intended to assist, not replace, human oversight. For critical or urgent issues, please contact a human team member or local authorities directly.
Limitation of Liability: We are not responsible for any consequences, damages, or losses that may arise from your reliance on AI-generated content or results. Your use of AI features is at your own risk.
Data & Privacy: Information shared may be used to improve our AI services and overall platform, in accordance with our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. Please avoid sharing highly sensitive personal or confidential information via public-facing AI tools.
